To Do

-   The deployment for the full app does not work. There is some unclear timing issue for the runtime stack. Every iteration some differnt exception pops up making it BRUTAL to troubleshoot.
-   Clean up workflows and understand the matrix better
-   File by file analysis. I want to understand ever line of code and if it's needed AND best practice. Will review with AI.
-   Fix Login form sizing
-   Explore the ExecutionRole for StorageStack. I'd like a central Execution role but that is causing circular dependencies.
-   TESTING!!!
-   Much better password reset
